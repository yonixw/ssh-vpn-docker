# SSH over OpenVPN in Docker

## Description
Connect to a SSH server (on a VM) using VPN with only 
affecting a specific docker and not your entire PC (letting you to browse the internet at the same time).

## How to run
1. Clone this repo
2. Configure the docker-compose.yml
    1. Mount your config to `/vpn/config/vpn_config.ovpn`
    2. Change your `ovpn` file to search keys\certs in `/vpn/config`
    3. Mount all needed files to `/vpn/config/` (see example `docker-compose.yml`)
3. Start the docker (will not connect to VPN yet)
4. Exec in docker `bash -c "./ssh.sh"`

## Get to the point ðŸ˜¡
Configure `docker-compose.yml` and run:
```
docker-compose up -d --build vpn && docker-compose exec vpn bash -c "./ssh.sh"
```

## Why so many docker permissions?
The following permissions are a must for VPN inside docker:
* `sysctls: "net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0"`
* `cap_add: NET_ADMIN`
* `devices: /dev/net/tun`

You are free to search the web and report if some can be removed.

## Can't we just forward packets inside the docker? 
If you are trying to do something like:
```
PC (SSH) -> port mapping in docker- -> docker -> VPN
```
I also tried and couldn't do it with iptables (port forwards) alone.
My guess is that the VPN take too much control of the packets and make the forward rules useless;
